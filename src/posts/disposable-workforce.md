With _Picard_ now on my screen, I decided to revisit one of the classics of the Trek canon, TNG Season 2's _The Measure of a Man_.

The villain of the episode, one Commander Bruce Maddox, is a bit of a tech bro. It's startling how well this holds up three decades later, since this kind of guy is still a problem.

A refresher: this episode was TNG at its hammiest and most thought-provoking. It centers a courtroom drama where the fate of Data hinges on a difficult question:

Does an android deserve basic "human rights?" To wit: the right of self-determination, of self-protection from experimentation. Maddox badly wants to take him apart and see how he works. Data, an expert on his own body and experience, believes Maddox runs a serious risk of permanently damaging or even killing him.

In a clever hack around Roddenberry's famed aversion for conflict between the crew, circumstances demand that Riker argue on behalf of Starfleet's interest in dismantling Data, leaving Picard as his advocate.

Riker, duty-bound to get the job done even if he doesn't want to, delivers a "devastating" presentation proving that Data is an elaborate machine. Picard, despondent, joins Guinan for a drink.

She warns Picard that civilizations love nothing more than to create "disposable people," to do the jobs no one else wants, with no recourse. By creating a special category that allows Data to be property by distinction of his mechanical composition, Guinan argues, the Federation is on the road to creating a permanent underclass.

This is what Picard needed: he wins the argument by appealing to Starfleet's high mindedness.

# Building it lean

This got me think about Silicon Valley's model for innovation in the age of the gig economy.

Today, androids are far beyond our technological capabilities. Not just the hardware, but the software. We can't build autonomous robots that can do the same work humans can.

So the Valley built it lean. Instead of building artificial laborers, **the tech industry constructed artificial supervisors**.

When the algorithm determines who gets fired, when you work, what you get paid, and anything else about your daily life, there's no limit to the extractive cruelty of the workplace.

The needs of the laborers are invisible to the software.

Under this model, you don't need to invent an entire android, nor do you need to bear the costs of its manufacture. Instead, software becomes an automated abstraction around real human lives. No one in the business need interact with them in any supervisory context.

They become rows in a database to be rearranged, or dropped.

We're left with algorithmically disposable people. Entirely commodified labor that can be discarded at will. No one has to look them in the eye when they're fired. No one needs to learn their stories, meet their kids, or otherwise engage with those who depend on them. The code takes care of everything, down to collecting the surplus value of their labor.

No one has to worry about a thingâ€”except the workers.

Gig workers are precarious not only because they lack benefits and predictable wages, but also because the everyday bedrock of their work is determined by a black box algorithm designed to extract maximum profit for a distant corporation.

They are simple inventory, made faceless to the business by software.

In Mike Isaac's chronicle of Uber's history and culture, Super Pumped, one of the most striking facts of the business is how optional it was for management to actually communicate with drivers. They could hide away, pop out to interact if they wanted to, or go on hiding. The money machine went on working either way. The software was doing the supervising.

This isn't just a function of software. This is technologists exploiting an unequal economy. You can't treat workers with this indifference if they have more appealing, more reliable, more humane options for making a living.

The gig economy depends on economic desperation and limited career opportunity.

Perhaps most striking is that Uber wanted to automate the entire system, from supervisor to driver. They succeeded quickly and easily with supervisors. Meanwhile, they plowed extraordinary sums into researching self driving cars only to get nowhere.

There's a lesson there in where value gets created.
